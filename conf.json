#This JSON configuration file stores a bunch of important variables. Let’s look at each of them:
#
#    show_video : A boolean indicating whether or not the video stream from the Raspberry Pi should be displayed to our screen.
#    use_dropbox : Boolean indicating whether or not the Dropbox API integration should be used.
#    dropbox_key : Your public Dropbox API key.
#    dropbox_secret : Your private Dropbox API key.
#    dropbox_base_path : The name of your Dropbox App directory that will store uploaded images.
#    min_upload_seconds : The number of seconds to wait in between uploads. For example, if an image was uploaded to Dropbox 5m 33s after starting our script, a second image would not be uploaded until 5m 36s. This parameter simply #controls the frequency of image uploads.
#    min_motion_frames : The minimum number of consecutive frames containing motion before an image can be uploaded to Dropbox.
#    camera_warmup_time : The number of seconds to allow the Raspberry Pi camera module to “warmup” and calibrate.
#    delta_thresh : The minimum absolute value difference between our current frame and averaged frame for a given pixel to be “triggered” as motion. Smaller values will lead to more motion being detected, larger values to less #motion detected.
#    resolution : The width and height of the video frame from our Raspberry Pi camera.
#    fps : The desired Frames Per Second from our Raspberry Pi camera.
#    min_area : The minimum area size of an image (in pixels) for a region to be considered motion or not. Smaller values will lead to more areas marked as motion, whereas higher values of min_area  will only mark larger regions as #motion.
